Build a modern, fast, static political portfolio website for a public figure:

Name: Suryabanshi Suraj
Designation: MLA, Dhamnagar Constituency
Minister, Government of Odisha

The website must be:

* Static (no backend server)
* Deployable on Vercel
* SEO optimized
* Mobile-first and highly responsive
* Clean, minimal, and professional (not flashy)
* Fast loading with optimized images

Primary purpose:

* Showcase public work and governance impact
* Provide official information
* Enable structured citizen contact
* Centralize social media presence

Include the following high-level sections:

1. Hero section with professional image, designation, and vision statement.
2. About section with biography and political journey.
3. Constituency & Development section highlighting initiatives, schemes, infrastructure, and measurable impact.
4. News & Media section linking to social profiles and press coverage.
5. Gallery of events and public engagement.
6. WhatsApp contact button.
7. Footer with official links and disclaimer.

Requirements:

* Use Next.js with static export.
* Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
* Follow best SEO practices (meta tags, structured data, Open Graph).
* Include schema markup for a public figure.
* Optimize for Lighthouse score above 90.
* Clean folder structure.
* Ready for Vercel deployment.
* No database, no backend server.

Design tone:

* Government-grade professionalism
* Trustworthy and authoritative
* Subtle color palette inspired by Odisha/state themes
* Large typography and strong hierarchy

Ensure scalability so that additional sections like dashboard, volunteer form, or event calendar can be added later.

Do not overengineer. Keep it simple, maintainable, and production-ready.
Do not use super new gen library or something. Use the usual.
